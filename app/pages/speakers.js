                    JavaZone takes place in Oslo, Norway, on September 7th-8th
                    2015. The conference offers a combination of technical talks
                    and workshops in an informal atmosphere with an expected
                    attendance of more than 2500 highly skilled developers.

                    JavaZone 2016 will be the 15th consecutive JavaZone conference,
                    and will consist of a day of workshops followed by two days
                    of presentations and (more) workshops. Last year's event was
                    a great success with more than 2500 attendees enjoying 150
                    talks covering a wide range of topics.  Speakers include both
                    internationally known names and home grown Norwegian talent.

                    Over the last decade JavaZone has grown to become one of
                    the most important Java events in Europe! You can see for
                    yourself â€“ videos from previous years are available for
                    free at Vimeo, and the full program from JavaZone 2015
                    can be found at last year's web page.

                    We can brag as much as we want, but JavaZone would be
                    nothing without all the great speakers! And that is why
                    we need your help to make sure that JavaZone 2016 will be
                    at least as awesome as the earlier events. If you think you
                    have something interesting to share, please submit your
                    talk or workshop by the 18th of April, 2016.

                    You should think about which format your talk will work
                    best in. Are you presenting a new idea, or do you require
                    more time to elaborate on your subject? How hands-on do
                    you want to be? We have three formats you can present
                    your material in.
