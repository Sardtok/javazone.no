                        Paying by invoice can be accommodated if needed (contact javazone@java.no), but please consider buying the tickets using the webshop if you can. Youâ€™ll get a receipt which can be used for reimbursements even though paying with credit card.

                        JavaZone is organized for and by the community. Your ticket includes a membership in javaBin, giving you access to all the javaBin community events and voting rights for a full year after buying the ticket.

                        Previously we used to sell tickets and memberships separatly, but you saved a total of 500 NOK by buying both. It seemed silly to force you through two separate web shops to collect this rebate, so we combined the two and thereby made the tickets cheaper to everyone. If you still would like to pay extra as before, let us know! ;-)
