                <p className='page__paragraph'>
                    JavaZone is a conference organized by and for a great community of developers.
                    Over the years it has become one of the largest and most important conferences in Norway,
                    hosting both participants and speakers from all over the world.
                    This year is a bit special â€“ JavaZone 2016 will be the 15th time we arrange this conference.
                </p>
                <p className='page__paragraph'>
                    Last year, we had around 2,500 attendees at the conference, including speakers and
                    volunteers and around 100 representatives from our partners.
                </p>
                <p className='page__paragraph'>
                    We would not be able to arrange a conference of this size and quality without 
                    the involvement and support of every one of our partners.
                    Each year, more than 40 partners contribute to make JavaZone a great success.

                <p className='page__paragraph'>
                    Every partner of JavaZone plays a big role in making the conference possible.
                    It is because of our partners that we have had the possibility to keep the high
                    quality that JavaZone is known to have.

                <p className='page__paragraph'>
                    All companies are given the same options when becoming a partner.
                    There is no bronze, silver or gold sponsorships, everyone are treated as equals.
                    There are, however, options to increase the size of the stand or buy in on one of
                    our restaurant stands. We are also willing to accomodate creative ideas, so please
                    let us know if you have anything special in mind.
