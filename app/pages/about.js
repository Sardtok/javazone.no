                JavaZone is a conference organized by and for a great community of developers.
                The conference has been held in the heart of Oslo for 14 consecutive years, and JavaZone 2016 will be the 15th time we arrange the conference.

                JavaZone is made by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. JavaZone is completely independent, and is made and run mainly with volunteer work.

            <h2 className="page__sub-title">Open Source</h2>

                We make almost every piece of software used to run the conference ourselves.
                And, as a true independent organization, we open source most of it as well.
                You can find most of our software over at <a href="https://github.com/javabin">Github</a>
