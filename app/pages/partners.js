            JavaZone is a conference organized by and for a great community of developers.
            The conference has been held in the heart of Oslo for 13 consecutive years, 
            and JavaZone 2015 will be the 14th time we arrange the conference.
        </p>
        <p className="partners__textblock">
            Last year, we had around 2,500 attendees at the conference, including speakers, 
            volunteers and around 100 representatives from our partners.

            We would not be able to arrange a conference of this size and quality without 
            the involvement and support of every one of our partners.
            Each year, more than 40 partners contribute to make JavaZone a great success.
